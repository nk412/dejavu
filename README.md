### 1. Dejavu Intro

**dejavu** is the just another web UI for Elasticsearch. Existing web UIs leave much to be desired or are built with server-side page rendering techniques that make it less responsive and bulkier to run (I am looking at you, Kibana).

We started building dejavu with the goal of creating a modern Web UI (no page reloads, infinite scroll, filtered views, realtime updates) for Elasticsearch with 100% client-side rendering so one can easily run it as a [hosted app on github pages](https://opensource.appbase.io/dejavu/live), [as a chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dejavu/jopjeaiilkcibeohjdmejhoifenbnmlh) or [as a docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/appbaseio/dejavu/).

Starting `v1.0`, dejavu is the only Elasticsearch web UI that supports importing data via JSON and CSV files, as well as defining field mappings from the GUI.

With the latest `v1.5`, we support the ability of creating custom headers so you can easily pass different authentication headers, provide enhanced filtering and bulk updating of data via Elasticsearch's Query DSL.

### 2. Features

#### Easily Connect and Remember Indices

![Connect to an Index](https://i.imgur.com/TksvSAS.gif)

Dejavu allows you to connect to any of the indexes present in your cluster and also caches each connected index locally so they are easily accessible when browsing again.

#### Visual Filters

![Filter Views](https://i.imgur.com/WzS1kTN.gif)

Sort through the data, find information visually, hide irrelevant data and make sense of all the text, numbers and dates. Filters work by identifying data mappings from the Elasticsearch index. If dejavu sees a ``text`` field, it will provide filters for **search**, **has** and **has not** and is also mindful if the data is analyzed. Similarly, a numeric field allows filtering on ranges and a date field allows filtering data by dates.

Moreover, any filtered view can be exported as a JSON or CSV file.

#### Enhanced Filtering with Queries

Dejavu also supports showing filtered views based on an Elasticsearch query, as well as bulk updating or deleting documents via the query DSL.

#### Modern UI elements

![Pagination](https://i.imgur.com/sEfSPwc.gif)

It's not uncommon to have thousands of documents in your index. Dejavu supports an infinite scroll based UI, pagination is so old school.

Dejavu also supports browsing data from multiple types, updating data either individually or via queries in bulk. Deletions are also supported.

#### Realtime Data Updates

![Realtime data updates](https://i.imgur.com/GrROJqz.gif)

dejavu uses a websockets based API and subscribes for data changes for the current filtered view. For this to work, the Elasticsearch server needs to support a websockets based publish API. Currently, you can take advantage of this feature by hosting your data with appbase.io.


#### Import JSON or CSV Data

Importer view allows importing CSV or JSON data directly into Elasticsearch through a guided data mappings configuration.

### 4. Roadmap


<s>Here's a rough roadmap of things to come in the version ``1.0.0`` release.</s>

:fireworks: We just hit the 1.0.0 roadmap.

- [x] Battle-testing with different datasets
- [x] Feature support for advanced filtering
<s>Offline detection and reconnection for realtime updates</s>
- [x] Performance improvements while scrolling
- [x] Support for importing and exporting data
- [x] Support for a continuous query view
- [x] Available as a docker image

Roadmap for version `2.0.0` release:

- [x] An intuitive data editing experience in tabular mode (v/s JSON edit mode)
- [x] View data types from within the data browser view
- [x] A more streamlined import process
- [ ] Create a test coverage suite
- [ ] Improve responsiveness and performance when browsing large datasets
- [ ] Refactor codebase to improve hackability (Migrate to React 16+, ES6 syntax)

Roadmap beyond v2:

- [ ] Support addition of custom analyzers, and updating index settings
- [ ] Make editing of data experience more intuitive (in addition to the raw JSON, show a relevant UI field with validations)
- [ ] Connectors to dashboarding systems for a more flavored visualization experience.

### 5. Build Locally

See the **[CONTRIBUTING File](./CONTRIBUTING.md)**

---

### 6. Get Dejavu

#### Docker Installation


```
docker run -p 1358:1358 -d appbaseio/dejavu
open http://localhost:1358/
```

You can also run a specific version of **dejavu** by specifying a tag. For example, version `1.0.0` can be used by specifying the ``docker run -p 1358:1358 appbaseio/dejavu:1.5.0`` command.

##### CORS

To make sure you enable CORS settings for your ElasticSearch instance, add the following lines in the ES configuration file.

```sh
http.port: 9200
http.cors.allow-origin: "http://localhost:1358"
http.cors.enabled: true
http.cors.allow-headers : X-Requested-With,X-Auth-Token,Content-Type,Content-Length,Authorization
http.cors.allow-credentials: true
```

If you are running your Elasticsearch with docker, you can use flags to pass the custom CORS configuration. See the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/appbaseio/dejavu/blob/dev/docker-compose.yml) file for an example.

###### Elasticsearch v2.x

`docker run --name es -d -p 9200:9200 elasticsearch:2 -Des.http.port=9200 -Des.http.cors.allow-origin="http://localhost:1358" -Des.http.cors.enabled=true -Des.http.cors.allow-headers=X-Requested-With,X-Auth-Token,Content-Type,Content-Length,Authorization -Des.http.cors.allow-credentials=true`

###### Elasticsearch v5.x

`docker run --name es -d -p 9200:9200 -d elasticsearch:5 -E http.port=9200 -E http.cors.allow-origin="http://localhost:1358" -E http.cors.enabled=true -E http.cors.allow-headers=X-Requested-With,X-Auth-Token,Content-Type,Content-Length,Authorization -E http.cors.allow-credentials=true`


#### Hosted Alternatives

can also be run via hosted app at https://opensource.appbase.io/dejavu/live or [installed as a chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dejavu/jopjeaiilkcibeohjdmejhoifenbnmlh).


For example: If you are using the chrome-extension instead of docker image, the `http.cors.allow-origin` in Elasticsearch.yml file would change accordingly:

```sh
http.port: 9200
http.cors.allow-origin: "chrome-extension://jopjeaiilkcibeohjdmejhoifenbnmlh"
http.cors.enabled: true
http.cors.allow-headers : X-Requested-With,X-Auth-Token,Content-Type,Content-Length,Authorization
http.cors.allow-credentials: true
```
